# SESYNC Summer Institute Team Title: Woody Weeds in Eastern Africa

www.woodyweeds.org

## The specific objectives of our project during the SESYNC Summer Institute will be: 
1.	a spatial assessment of current SOC stocks in Baringo County, 
2.	an assessment of past SOC stocks and how these have changed over the past 30 years (as a result of changes in land use and land cover and Prosopis invasion),
3.	modelling of future land use and IAS management scenario(s) and their impact on SOC stocks, and
4.	an assessment of what the implications of the other objectives are for carbon credits and livelihoods, in particular the effect of grassland restoration on the carrying capacity with respect to cattle.
